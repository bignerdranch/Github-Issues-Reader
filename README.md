# Github-Issues-Reader
A super cool app for reading github issues that definitely doesn't already exist 

## Purpose
Playground application for Via's 2022 apprenticeship program.
* Simulates a small project with a designer, project manager and a tech lead.
* User stories are written as issues, changes must be completed via pull request and must be reviewed before being merged.
* Used to write and practice real code in addition to acting as a familiar playground for pairing / teaching new concepts
